## Predict Stock Market Index Using RNNs

### Project Overview
The work is part of continuing research that is to examine the feasibility and performance of machine learning architectures in predicting time series data. Our focus at thi point is on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We are going to tackle the problem of stock market index prediction. Three models have been implemented using Keras with Tensorflow backend:
* RNN
* RNN with LSTM
* RNN with GRU 

### Results
Being trained with the 2-year-long Shanghai-Shenzhen CSI-300 5-minute data, the models can predict future index of the 3-month-long test data with a high degree of accuracy. All of the three models achieved comparable performance, as summarized below.  

| Models | MSE | RMSE | Accuracy |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----:|
| RNN | 126.15 | 11.23 | 0.84 |
| LSTM | 266.34 | 16.32 | 0.84 |
| GRU | 116.38 | 10.79 | 0.89 | 

The accuracy metrics reported above refers to hourly mean directional predictive accuracy, which compares the movement direction (upward or downward) of prediction to that of actual observation, with 1-hour look-back period.

### Repo Contents
* `data/` : directory containing Shanghai-Shenzhen CSI-300 5-minute data between Apr. 2010 and Apr. 2019.
* `figures/` : directory containing plots generated by objects of the `ModelPredictions` class.
* `src/` : python and jupyter notebook source codes:
  * `data-prepration.py` : defines the `StockIndexDataset` class, which builds a data pipeline to 
* `scrape/` : jupyter notebooks and csv output from reddit and reuters headline scraping
* `helpers.py` : some python helper functions, including plotting and date manipulation
* `lstm.py` : defines the `StockModel()` class, including training and testing methods (see below for full description of methods and attributes)
* `main.py` : python file to loop through stock tickers, train `StockModel()` classes from `lstm.py`, and save figures

## Setup and Run
To quickly get a functional implementation of our model, follow the `demos/PredictionDemo_AAPL.py` skeleton by running:
```python
from lstm import StockModel

aapl_model = StockModel('AAPL')
aapl_model.loadStock()
model, history = aapl_model.train()
rmse = aapl_model.validate(model)

# perform downstream analyses and prediction on test set using keras model
```
