## Predict Stock Market Index Using RNNs

### Project Overview
The work is part of continuing research that is to examine the feasibility and performance of machine learning architectures in predicting time series data. Our focus at thi point is on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We have implemented three models using Keras with Tensorflow backend:
* RNN
* RNN with LSTM
* RNN with GRU 

The problem to be tackled is stock market index prediction based on historical data.

We pass the features to an LSTM RNN to train future stock price prediction. Following training, our model can predict future stock prices with high accuracy and attains high returns on investment while investing as an agent.

Our model `StockModel()` is a class in `lstm.py`. We have two demos of the model's predictions on the Apple stock (AAPL) in the `demos/` directory. The Jupyter notebook is a standalone working demo of the model on AAPL, with outputs preprinted in-line for easy viewing. The same outputs can also be produced by running `python PredictionDemo_AAPL.py`. Note that we have not yet finished tuning hyperparameters on other stocks besides AAPL.

## Results
Being trained with the 2-year-long Shanghai-Shenzhen CSI-300 5-minute data, the models can predict future index of the 3-month-long test data with a high degree of accuracy. All of the three models achieved comparable performance, as summarized below.  

| Models | MSE | RMSE | Accuracy |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----:|
| RNN | 126.15 | 11.23 | 0.84 |
| LSTM | 266.34 | 16.32 | 0.84 |
| GRU | 116.38 | 10.79 | 0.89 | 


Our LSTM RNN model learns to "buy-low sell-high":

Our LSTM RNN model achieves significant return on investment in our test set (2016 calendar year):

## Setup and Run
To quickly get a functional implementation of our model, follow the `demos/PredictionDemo_AAPL.py` skeleton by running:
```python
from lstm import StockModel

aapl_model = StockModel('AAPL')
aapl_model.loadStock()
model, history = aapl_model.train()
rmse = aapl_model.validate(model)

# perform downstream analyses and prediction on test set using keras model
```
